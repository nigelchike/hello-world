# hello-world
hello world tutorial. My first repository
This is my first branch creation. I am now editing the branch
I will commit the branch to update the master.
My name is Nigel. I just started taking a data science class on Coursera offered by JHU.
I have learned a lot so far and I think it is going to be an interesting journey.
I do need to start spending some time in class forum and getting to know others in my class.
